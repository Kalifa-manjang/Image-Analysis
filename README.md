In this project, I conducted an object measurement using i1 pro spectrophotometer and also with the Nikon D80 digital camera and compared the results. The main objective of this Project is to ensure the accuracy of color measurement using the Nikon D80 digital camera and validate its results using the reference spectrophotometer measurements that were taken in the lab.
